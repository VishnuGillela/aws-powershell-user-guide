# What Are the AWS Tools for PowerShell?<a name="pstools-welcome"></a>

The AWS Tools for PowerShell are a set of PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by the AWS SDK for \.NET\. The AWS Tools for PowerShell enable you to script operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell command line\. 

The cmdlets provide an idiomatic PowerShell experience for specifying parameters and handling results even though they are implemented using the various AWS service HTTP query APIs\. For example, the cmdlets for the AWS Tools for PowerShell support PowerShell pipeliningâ€”that is, you can pipe PowerShell objects in and out of the cmdlets\.

The AWS Tools for PowerShell are flexible in how they enable you to handle credentials, including support for the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) infrastructure\. You can use the tools with IAM user credentials, temporary security tokens, and IAM roles\.

The AWS Tools for PowerShell support the same set of services and AWS Regions that are supported by the SDK\. You can install the AWS Tools for PowerShell on computers running Windows, Linux, or macOS operating systems\.

The AWS Tools for PowerShell are available as the following three distinct packages:
+ [AWS\.Tools](#pwsh_structure_pstools)
+ [AWSPowerShell\.NetCore](#pwsh_structure_pscore)
+ [AWSPowerShell](#pwsh_structure_psoldwin)
