# What are the AWS Tools for PowerShell?<a name="pstools-welcome"></a>

The AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell and AWS Tools for PowerShell Core are PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by the AWS SDK for \.NET\. The AWS PowerShell Tools enable you to script operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell command line\. Although the cmdlets are implemented using the service clients and methods from the SDK, the cmdlets provide an idiomatic PowerShell experience for specifying parameters and handling results\. For example, the cmdlets for the Tools for Windows PowerShell support PowerShell pipeliningâ€”that is, you can pipe PowerShell objects in and out of the cmdlets\.

The Tools for Windows PowerShell and Tools for PowerShell Core are flexible in how they enable you to handle credentials, including support for the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) infrastructure; you can use the tools with IAM user credentials, temporary security tokens, and IAM roles\.

The Tools for PowerShell support the same set of services and regions that are supported by the SDK\. You can install the Tools for PowerShell on computers running Windows\-based, Linux\-based, or macOS operating systems\.
