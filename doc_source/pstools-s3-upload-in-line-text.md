# Upload In\-Line Text Content to Amazon S3<a name="pstools-s3-upload-in-line-text"></a>

The Write\-S3Object cmdlet supports the ability to upload in\-line text content to Amazon S3\. Using the `-Content` parameter \(alias `-Text`\), you can specify text\-based content that should be uploaded to Amazon S3 without needing to place it into a file first\. The parameter accepts simple one\-line strings as well as here strings that contain multiple lines\.

```
# Specifying content in-line, single line text:
write-s3object mybucket -key myobject.txt -content "file content"

# Specifying content in-line, multi-line text: (note final newline needed to end in-line here-string)
write-s3object mybucket -key myobject.txt -content @"
>> line 1
>> line 2
>> line 3
>> "@
>>

# Specifying content from a variable: (note final newline needed to end in-line here-string)
$x = @"
>> line 1
>> line 2
>> line 3
>> "@
>>
write-s3object mybucket -key myobject.txt -content $x
```
